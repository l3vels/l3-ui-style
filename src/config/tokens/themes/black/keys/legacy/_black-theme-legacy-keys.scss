//  BLACK THEME TOKENS: LEGACY KEYS
// - This partial defines Black Theme's legacy keys tokens
// - Legacy keys are colors that are not part of the theme's keys
// - Legacy keys are currently presented as custom properties
// - Due to separation between Registration and Semantic candidates sort order between group is important
//   - Some Semantic candidates are aliases or Registration colors (as it should be)
// - Legacy keys might be in use within themes.
// - Per now they cannot be deprecated.
// - We define a token as a legacy key when:
//   - It has a legacy registration color as value.(value duplication)
//   - It has name that indicates a certain role
//   - It is abstract and not tied to a specific use. (such as some legacy tokens)
//   - Some other token is using them and it makes a sense (connection is clear)
// - This way we eliminate duplication for hard coded value declaration.

// # Not in Vibe UI definitions
